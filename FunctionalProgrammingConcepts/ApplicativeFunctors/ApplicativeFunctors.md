# Applicative Functors

### Applicative Functors: the ability to apply functors to each other

### ap is a function that can apply the function contents of one functor to the value contents of another.

### An applicative functor is a pointed functor with an ap method.
__Note: A pointed functor is a functor with an 'of' method__
