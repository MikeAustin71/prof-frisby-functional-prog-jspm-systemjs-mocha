# Referential Transparency
Many believe the biggest win when working with pure functions is referential transparency. A spot of code is referentially transparent when it can be substituted for its evaluated value without changing the behavior of the program.
 Since pure functions always return the same output given the same input, we can rely on them to always return the same results and thus preserve referential transparency.
